# learn_vue

This is a repo I create for learning vue.
In the _examples_ directory, you could find an application written in three ways, in plain html (import vue from CDN), in modularized project (CDN too) and in vite project (build). The original application is not my work, I just modify them to learn different ways to use Vue.

In _typonym_slot_machine_, I create a my own first application borrowing the one in _examples_, I don't focus on CSS but only JS. To be done.
